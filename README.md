## Overview
Very simple, no JS necessary. Using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static website generator and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for building.

## Getting started

**[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/):**

* On OSX with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install hugo`
* Or download a release from here: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

This setup needs at least Hugo version 0.37.1.

### Development

Start development mode (with hot reloading):

```
hugo server -D
```

Then you can visit the generated site at http://localhost:1313. As soon as source files change, hugo builds and reloads the page.
